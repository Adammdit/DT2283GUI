1) Shoping list App Specification - "DailyCheck"
  • First, the user is asked to enter their name, gender, job title (from a predefined 
    list), age, a total available amount of money to be spent and an email address.
  • Once this is entered, the app goes to a list screen which displays a list of 
    items (including item name, description and price)
  • From that list, the user can select one or more items to be put on the shopping 
    list; When they finished their selection, they indicate they have finished (e.g. 
    OK button)
  • The system will check if they have exceeded their available amount to spend, 
    and keep them back to the list if they have.
  • Once finished selecting their items from the list, the user can click a button 
    which will display their selected items statically (not as a list) on another
    screen within the app, including cost pre Vat, VAT (@21%) and total cost
